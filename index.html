      <p>
        The author earned his B.Stat.(Hons.) and M.Stat. degrees from the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata in 2008, and later completed his masters studies at the University of California, Berkeley. During high school, he qualified for the Regional Mathematical Olympiad and was selected for Chennai Mathematical Institute's B.Sc.(Hons.) program in Mathematics and Computer Science.
      </p>
      <p>
        His professional journey spans multiple domains: four years in quantitative trading at Morgan Stanley, two years in quantitative investing at Goldman Sachs, and a leadership role as Head of Artificial Intelligence at a fintech unicorn. He founded pandainuniv.com, an educational platform that guides students through PhD decision-making.
      </p>
      <p>
        This cross-disciplinary background in quantitative finance and artificial intelligence informs his approach to demonstrating how mathematical theory connects to practical applications. His own struggles with entrance examinations inspired him to develop the preparatory resources he once needed. His enthusiasm for Number Theory began in high school, when he first encountered the field's elegant structures.
